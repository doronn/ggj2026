# Breaking Hue - RYB Color Puzzle Game

## Overview

A puzzle game using the RYB (Red-Yellow-Blue) color model where players collect and combine masks to pass through color-coded barriers.

## Color System (RYB)

### Primary Colors
- **Red** - Primary
- **Yellow** - Primary  
- **Blue** - Primary

### Secondary Colors (combinations)
- **Orange** = Red + Yellow
- **Green** = Yellow + Blue
- **Purple** = Red + Blue

### Tertiary Color
- **Black** = Red + Yellow + Blue (all primaries)

## New Mechanics

### Multi-Mask Toggle System
- Press 1/2/3 to toggle individual masks active/inactive
- Multiple masks can be active simultaneously
- Combined colors are displayed on the player

### Residue System
When passing through barriers, only the required colors are consumed:
- Example: Purple mask (R+B) passing through Red barrier leaves Blue residue

### Barrels
- Blocks entities without matching mask color
- Explodes when entity with matching color enters
- Player death → return to checkpoint
- Bot death → drops remaining masks

### Bots
- Follow predefined paths
- Pick up masks (only colors they don't have)
- Can pass through barriers using same rules as player
- Stop when colliding with player

### Portals & Checkpoints
- Bidirectional portals connect areas/levels
- Checkpoint portals save game state
- Death returns player to last checkpoint

### Hidden Areas
- Dark gray blocks reveal secrets when entered
- No condition required - just touch them
